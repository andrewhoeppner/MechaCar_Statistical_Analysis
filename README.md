# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview

* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes

* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots

* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population

* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Linear Regression to Predict MPG](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94339449/162590080-781df7ed-6f1e-4f46-9de0-588b3b587573.png)

In the image above we can see that:

* The vehicle_length and ground_clearance coeeficients do a provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. We know this because a 95% level of confidence was predetermined, meaning the p-value should be compared to alpha = 0.05 level of significance to verify if statistically significant.

* With a p-Value of 5.35e-11, we can say that the slope is not zero. We know this because it is smaller then the assumed significance level of 0.05.

* With r-squared being .7149, that means the linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. In the total_summary this is true with a variance of 62.3. This is also true for lots 1 and 2, however lot 3 has a variance of 170.29 which is well above the allowed variance of 100. Therefore lot 3 does not meet the necessary suspension coil requiremenets.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

The image above shows a T-test of all the lots. With the p-value being 0.06028 it is still greater then 0.05, which means the total manufacturing lot is not statistically significant from the normal distribution and normality can be assumed.

The above image shows a T-test for lots 1-3.

### Lot 1
Lot 1 has a p-value of 1 which is greater then 0.05, therefore lot 1 is not statistically significant from the normal distribution and normality can be assumed.

### Lot 2
Lot 2 has a p-value of 0.6072 which is greater then 0.05, therefore lot 1 is not statistically significant from the normal distribution and normality can be assumed.

### Lot 3
Lot 3 has a p-value of 0.04168 which is less then 0.05, therefore which means it is statistically significant from the normal distribution and normality cannot be assumed.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
A linear regression on city and highway fuel efficiency is another statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition.

#### Metrics to test:
* Horse power, vehicle weight, if it is AWD, RWD, FWD, 4WD
* The null hypothesis being that the horse power, vehicle weight, if it is AWD, RWD, FWD, 4WD doesnt affect the MPG
* Alternative hypothesis being that the horse power, vehicle weight, if it is AWD, RWD, FWD, 4WD does affect the MPG
